<p>Tallinn University seeks to hire two <strong>Research Fellows in Cultural Data Analytics</strong>, particularly in (1) Audiovisual Machine Learning, and (2) Cultural Dynamics, to work on ambitious, high-impact research at the CUDAN ERA Chair (chair holder Prof. Dr. Maximilian Schich). Start of the employment contract: 01.07.- 01.09.2021, duration of the contract is up to 31.12.2023. Deadline of submitting the application documents is 31st May, 2021.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the positions is in the <a href="https://www.tlu.ee/en/bfm">Baltic Film, Media, and Arts School</a> and the other is in the <a href="https://www.tlu.ee/en/dt">School of Digital Technologies</a>.</p>
<p><strong>General description of the field</strong>: Cultural Data Analytics</p>
<p>Successful candidates will join the CUDAN ERA Chair project in Cultural Data Analytics, which is funded by the European Commission in the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program with 2.5 million Euro (Grant no. 810961). The selected fellows will complement a highly multidisciplinary research group, currently consisting of 4 faculty, 4 senior fellows, and 5 PhD Students. Current expertise includes art history, algorithmic curation, cultural history, cultural semiotics, computational linguistics, computer science, computational social science, creative industry studies, digital education, evolutionary economics, generative art, machine learning, media innovation, media policy, and network science. Bridging three university schools, the research group collaborates with high-profile academic partners that are spread across the globe, while cooperating with several public and private stakeholders. These include libraries, museums, media institutions, and open data providers. The research group activity forms the core of the CUDAN Open Lab, performing research while simultaneously functioning as a forum for intellectual exchange and meaningful academic mixing. Together, our aim is to systematically deepen our understanding of cultural interaction and dynamics from deep history to the present. We harness a rare high-risk/high-gain opportunity of combining cutting-edge computation, quantification, qualitative inquiry, critical and creative aesthetics, in close collaboration and co-authorship. Our core mission is to produce and publish exemplary proofs of concepts in high-impact papers and to act as an incubator for follow-up projects and applications, while cross-fertilizing knowledge and methods across disciplines and with external stakeholders. Successful candidates will be provided with data-science-grade laptops, conference travel funds, and opportunities to collaborate with international partners. The lab environment provides ergonomic co-working spaces with individual adjustable desks and secondary screens, large blackboards, state-of-the-art projection, video conferencing and HPC equipment. The working language of the CUDAN research group is English.
