**Bio**  
  
Mark Mets is a junior research fellow at CUDAN and a PhD student at the Tallinn University in the School of Humanities. His research explores the topic of cultural other and the limits and potentials of understanding it better with cultural data analysis. Cultural other is a concept important for both humanities and social sciences, connected to topics such as cultural representations, polarization and homogenization. Mark finished his MA in Semiotics at the University of Tartu, where he focused on the theoretical analysis of experimental semiotics. His current research combines semiotics with cultural data analysis to explore novel interdisciplinary approaches to cultural phenomena with digital methods.
