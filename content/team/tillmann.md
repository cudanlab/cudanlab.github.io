**Bio**  
  
Tillmann Ohm is an artist and creative technologist with a special focus on complex curatorial systems. He combines network science, machine learning and digital archives with exhibition-making to develop experimental tools for curating art and engaging with cultural artefacts.

Ohm graduated from Bauhaus University Weimar with a diploma in Fine Arts in 2018 and received the Bauhaus Graduation Scholarship for his artistic project of computational research in the field of artificial intelligence in contemporary art. His work was further funded and awarded with the Scholarship for Visual Artists 2019 by the Cultural Foundation of the Free State of Saxony. In June 2020, he created the first algorithmically curated art exhibition at HALLE 14 Center for Contemporary Arts in Leipzig, Germany. Since September 2020, Tillmann Ohm works as a Junior Research Fellow for the EU funded research project of Cultural Data Analytics (CUDAN) and School of Digital Technologies at Tallinn University in Estonia.
