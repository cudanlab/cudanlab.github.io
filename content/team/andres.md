**About**
  
Andres wants to know why and how all languages and cultures keep changing over time. To that end, he makes use of a variety of methods - machine learning applied to large text corpora, computational simulations, and communication experiments with human participants.
  

**Bio**  
  
Andres Karjus is a computational linguist who recently completed his PhD on the topic of lexical dynamics at the Centre for Language Evolution at the University of Edinburgh. He studies language and culture using a combination of text corpora, computational simulations and human experiments. All these approaches produce lots of information, usually too much to analyze qualitatively - this is where careful application of machine learning and rigorous statistical modelling can help to make sense of (and make predictions based on) the data. Andres is currently engaged in a number of projects, involving artificial language experiments, looking into changes in language in social and traditional media, and investigating dynamics of visual art complexity.
