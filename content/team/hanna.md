**Bio**  
  
Hanna has a BA degree in Government & Politics from University of Tartu, an MSc degree in European Governance from University of Bristol, and an MA degree in New Media & Digital Culture from University of Amsterdam. She has worked as a researcher at Unitas Foundation and Transparency International Estonia and as an adviser for digital and energy efficiency topics at the Estonian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications. Within the current project she aims to analyse the data practices of traditional media companies that in addition to private value offer public value. In addition to data practices for business and content purposes, the aim is to study the broader environment and address issues such as privacy, competition and consumer protection policies.
