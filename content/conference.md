## About CUDAN 2023  

The **Cultural Data Analytics Conference 2023** / **CUDAN 2023** is scheduled to happen in **Tallinn, Estonia** from **December 13 to 16, 2023**, including a number of leading invited practitioners, peer-reviewed long talks, and lightning+poster contributions from the community. The conference is organized by the ERA Chair project for Cultural Data Analytics at Tallinn University, generously funded by the European Commission. Inspired by initial large gatherings of the cultural analytics community, including [UCLA/IPAM 2016](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/culture-analytics/), and multidisciplinary conferences such as [NetSci](https://netscisociety.net/home), [IC2S2](https://www.ic2s2.org/index.html), or [CCS](https://cssociety.org/home), we aim to bring together researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders using methods of cultural data analytics to understand cultures and cultural production. This particularly includes multidisciplinary combinations of quantification, qualitative inquiry, computational analysis, and visualization to make sense of large cultural datasets, including visual, audiovisual, linguistic, and other genres of socio-cultural materials.  

Confirmed ***keynotes***, accepted ***long talks***, and accepted ***lighting talk and poster*** combinations are listed below. Further information includes the ***conference scope***, ***key dates***, ***registration & accommodation***, the now closed ***call for abstracts***, the team of ***organizers***, and the international ***program committee*** members (who have performed peer-review).  

**[Conference registration](https://konverentsikeskus.tlu.ee/en/cudan-2023-conference-registration-form)** for accepted authors, PC members, CUDAN affiliates, and guests was made available free of charge, thanks to funding through the European Commission. Pre-conference workshops required free separate [signup](https://forms.gle/n6ETYKHLw17KNxP46).  

**We welcome on-site participants in Tallinn from December 13 to 16!**  

**The conference will be live-streamed, with streaming links appearing here in the morning of Dec 14, 8:45 Tallinn time**

*CUDAN 2023 Conference schedule (2023-12-12 version)* 

## Program schedule description

The pre-conference day (December 13, 2023) features **introductory workshops** by CUDAN senior fellows, covering aspects of cultural data analysis and visualization (see detailed schedule below). The workshops required a free separate signup: [https://forms.gle/n6ETYKHLw17KNxP46](https://forms.gle/n6ETYKHLw17KNxP46).

The CUDAN 2023 main conference schedule is set to run over three full days (December 14-16, 2023), including four **keynote** lectures, two **keynote panel sessions**, a set of **long talks** and a set of **lightning talk/poster combinations**. Most long talks and all lighting talks are scheduled to happen in the plenum (Tallinn University Audimax A001), while afternoon long talks are scheduled in two parallel tracks (rooms A001 and directly adjacent A046). The poster session will run throughout the whole conference in the coffee and lunch area, collocated with both lecture halls. Catering throughout the whole event is free of charge for registered participants. The main conference program will close with a best poster and best long talk award ceremony. Special events include an ***AI Art Exhibit Reception*** with food and drinks (December 15, free for all registered participants). A **meet the publishers session** and a **group photo** will precede the morning keynote on December 15 and 16. 


Before and after the main conference (December 13 & 17), we will offer **walking tours**, including the medieval [Tallinn old town](https://www.visitestonia.com/en/where-to-go/tallinn/tallinn-old-town), the [ Christmas market](https://www.visitestonia.com/en/why-estonia/christmas-in-tallinn), and a tour along the coast into the forest (all among many reasons to [visit Estonia](https://www.visitestonia.com/en/)). Warm clothing is highly recommended. Separate registration was sent to participants via email.

## Conference scope  

Cultures and cultural production are multifaceted phenomena, which, like other complex systems, cannot be fully understood from the perspective of a single specific discipline. This is why the core mission of cultural data analytics is to join forces and make headway across disciplines and domains of expertise. Feeding into this mission, we welcomed both multidisciplinary submissions, and contributions from specific disciplines, which aim to benefit from discussion in a multidisciplinary forum.

We encourage discussion towards a deeper understanding of cultures and cultural production including aspects, methods, and intersections of the following fields:  
– cultural analytics, culturomics, and socio-cultural data science;  
– digital humanities and computational humanities;  
– cultural evolution, including experimental and observational approaches;  
– cultural complexity science, network science, computational social science, and social physics;  
– computational linguistics, quantitative aesthetics, critical computer vision, and machine learning;  
– art history, cultural history, cultural semiotics, film studies, musicology, and urbanism;  
– artistic research, algorithmic curation, and AI art (including aspects of cultural data analysis);  
– creative industries research, media economics, and policy studies;  
– data journalism, data science, and information visualization.  

Contributions ideally address at least one of the following subject domains (in line with state-of-the-art conceptual reference models for cultural data):  
– *material aspects*, including artworks, architecture, texts, images, sound, film, digital media, databases, and other forms of tangible cultural heritage;  
– *conceptual aspects*, including cultural practices, rituals, theories, policies, data models, narratives, imagined communities, and other forms of intangible cultural heritage;  
– *social aspects*, including human behaviour, human mobility, social networks, and social media;  
– *temporal aspects*, from slow historical processes to turbulence in today's economy of attention;    
– *spatial aspects* of historical topography, cultural geography, and urban dynamics;  
– *event aspects*, which combine the above aspects in cultural co-production, event series, tourism, etc.;  
– *network aspects* of socio-cultural interaction, including the inherent ecology of complex networks as documented in the structure and dynamics of large cultural knowledge graphs or blockchains associated with the crypto-art-market, for example.

## Call for Abstracts (closed)  

We invited authors to submit a **single-page abstract pdf** including a (mandatory) descriptive figure and caption by the **24th of July 2023** via our [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=CUDAN.tlu.ee/2023/Conference) submission system. We accepted a total of 49 long contributed talks and 27 combined lightning talks & posters, by a total of 157 accepted co-authors. We strive for an in-person event to maximize community interaction, yet we will offer a limited amount of remote presentation slots. Review was single-blind and performed by a college of 65 Programme Committee members (as listed below). 

In the spirit of multidisciplinary abstract conferences and idea conferences, we encouraged submissions that aim to present entirely novel work, and also recently published contributions which would benefit from broader multidisciplinary discussion, asking authors to cite the original publication venue in the latter case.   

**SUBMISSIONS & REVIEWS: https://openreview.net/group?id=CUDAN.tlu.ee/2023/Conference**
