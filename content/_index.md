>Our project aims at building a new analytical approach, called “Cultural Data Analytics” that integrates quantitative and qualitative methods, including aspects of network science, complexity science, computational social science, science of science, machine learning, data science, design research, visualization, art history, cultural semiotics, digital culture studies, and creative industries’ studies to work with digitized cultural heritage as well as with born-digital data acquired from contemporary platforms.

The project aims will be accomplished by establishing an **ERA Chair** (a professorship) position and the transdisciplinary and innovative cooperation platform – **Open Lab** – at Tallinn University.

The ERA Chair, funded by the European Commission, will as a whole link existing capabilities of studying creative industries, open data, cultural dynamics and policy making thus creating synergies across multiple areas, in order to connect and combine various data sources to cultural practices of both consumption and production. As a team the chair consists of at minimum one professor and her/his associates. Three of Tallinn University schools cooperate in facilitating the ERA Chair: the Baltic Film, Media and Arts School (BFM), the School of Humanities (SH) and the School of Digital Technologies (SDT). One of the aims of the project is to develop new interdisciplinary cooperation models between different schools.

The practical extension of the ERA Chair will be the **CUDAN Open Lab**. The Open Lab will be a cooperation platform designed to work with multiple external partners, both public and private. Therein the aim will be to collect, analyze and use digital cultural data and to develop relevant new analytic methods – all in order to better understand contemporary cultural dynamics and incorporate this understanding into public cultural service designs, and cultural and creative industries’ policymaking processes. Many of the relevant partners TLU is already cooperating with, but now the aim is to do it more systematically by developing new cooperation formats and entirely new physical space for the Open Lab.

Tallinn University (TU) has elected Maximilian Schich to fill the ERA Chair in Cultural Data Analytics. He moved to Tallinn from the University of Texas at Dallas in June 2020. More info see [www.schich.info](http://www.schich.info).
