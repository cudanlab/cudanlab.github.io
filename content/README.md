# How-To 


# Adding new entries to the events page   
Every event is a file by its own inside the events folder. For consistency, filenames should start with the date followed by a clear title as in: 2021-02-08-deb-verhoeven-cudan-lecture.md 

Please use the example file *example-event.md* in the examples folder.   
**IMPORTANT!** The start and end date needs to have the date-format: 2021-02-08T10:00:00-00:00  

Put the abstract text and other additional information that should be hidden in the events page list after this tag:

# General styling rules  
The markdown files are following the markdown syntax:

**IMPORTANT!** Linebreaks need two white spaces!  


# Best practise  
Always use your own GitHub account when you commit changes. The safest method for editing existing content or adding new events is to stay in GitHub browser and use only https://github.com/cudanlab/cudanlab.github.io/tree/edit/content
