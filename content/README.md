# How-To edit and add content


# Adding new entries to the events page   
Every event is a file by its own inside the events folder. For consistency, filenames should start with the date followed by a clear title as in: 2021-02-08-deb-verhoeven-cudan-lecture.md 

Please use the example file *example-event.md* in the examples folder as reference.   
**IMPORTANT!** The start and end date needs to have the date-format: 2021-02-08T10:00:00-00:00  
The event title cannot contain quotation marks. Any mistake will result in a notification email.

Put the abstract text and other additional information that should be hidden in the events page list after this tag:

# General styling rules  
The markdown files are following the markdown syntax:

**IMPORTANT!** Linebreaks need two white spaces!  

# Best practice  
Always use your own GitHub account when committing changes. The safest method for editing existing content or adding new events is to stay in the GitHub browser and stay only in this directory: https://github.com/cudanlab/cudanlab.github.io/tree/edit/content   
If you want to use git from your local machine, always pull origin fromt he main branch before committing!
