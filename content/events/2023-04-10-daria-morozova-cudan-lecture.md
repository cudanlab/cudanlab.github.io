**Abstract** â€“ How does working with AI change the outcomes of creative work, and why? In two research projects covered in this talk, I investigate how perceptions of AI and beliefs about what differentiates people from machines impact the creative process. Drawing on the dual pathway to creativity model, I develop a framework that predicts contrasting creative outcomes for AI-curious, AI-cautious, and AI-skeptical individuals. I demonstrate that caution and skepticism about AI induce participants to explore fewer conceptual spaces and come up with less elaborate ideas. I also find that when AI as a creative actor constitutes a challenge to human uniqueness, individuals exert more effort than they would in working with another human. Next, I investigate how people use AI-generated prompts in creative and non-creative work. I show that in creative tasks, AI prescriptions appear to limit human imagination compared to AI suggestions and any human advice, while engendering closer convergence to the prompt.
