**Abstract** â€“ We are a group of young, motivated researchers with backgrounds spanning physics, computer and engineering science, and sociology, working at Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Trento, Italy. We are interested in the study of Human Social Behavior from different angles and contexts, tackling complex phenomena with tools ranging from statistical physics, mathematical modeling, network science, and data analysis. In this seminar, we will present a brief overview of our research projects and methodologies, including cooperation and decision-making, mobility and urbanism, and online media and culture.
