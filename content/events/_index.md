EVENTS
==  

> CUDAN events include our **Open Lab Seminar series**, including **Lectures** (featuring international guests), **Lab Encounters** (featuring international lab groups), and **CUDAN@ events** (where group members are featured elsewhere). Full information on the Cultural Data Analytics Conference 2023 is available on a dedicated [cudan.tlu.ee/conference/](https://cudan.tlu.ee/conference/). Previous event recordings are available on our Youtube channel [youtube.com/@CUDANLab/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@CUDANLab/videos).  

> The **Open Lab Seminar series** was initiated during the **CUDAN ERA Chair** project duration in Fall 2020 by the ERA Chair holder and team. The functional principle of the event series has been and remains to feature a broad diversity of voices, suggested and selected by indvidual community members, who are themselves covering a broad multidisciplinary spectrum. As a result the concert of seminar events constitutes an emerging definition of Cultural Data Analytics, which could not be achieved by an individual scholar, a single research group, or one institution.
