**Abstract** – Digitalization is both continuity and disruption. 'Continuity' means that there is an embryonic digitality before and independent of the computer. 'Disruption' means that completely new options for interacting with machines and artificial intelligence (contemporary chatbots etc.) are emerging as a result of datification in the context of big data. And yet there is a binding factor that holds both perspectives together. This is the 'cultural technique of flattening' understood as a creative anthropotechnical potential: Without working with inscribed and illustrated surfaces - from the invention of images, writing, and diagrams to the computer screens and smartphones that permeate our everyday lives today - sciences and many of the arts, complex technology, architecture and administration would not be possible. Digitalization relates to this cultural technology and radicalizes it at the same time. The talk will describe, explain, and comment on this subject.
