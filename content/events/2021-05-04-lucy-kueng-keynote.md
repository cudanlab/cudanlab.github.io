**Abstract** – News organisations have been on a digital transformation journey for two decades.  Strategies and business models are now mostly clear, but progress is slow and successful digital pivots an anomaly.  Having a strategy is not the same as achieving it:  implementation means moving from rational plans to the messy realities of human action, to a complex set of intertwined changes in how organisations are led, structured and staffed, and in how people in them think, act and take decisions. Taking the central themes of Leadership, Culture, Gens Y and Z, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and New talent, Roles and Structures, this book draws on over a hundred interviews to lay out how internal organisations need to be reshaped.  It explores the central challenges, and presents best practice approaches for each element, to ensure hearts and minds are truly harnessed to really go digital.
