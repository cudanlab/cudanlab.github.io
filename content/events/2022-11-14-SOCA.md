**Abstract** â€“ Armand Leroi et al. from Social and Cultural Analytics Lab, Imperial College London will engage in lab encounter with the CUDAN Lab.

Culture and society have gone digital. Vast amounts of cultural and social data are suddenly available. The Social and Cultural Analytics (SOCA) Lab brings together Imperial College researchers, and friends from allied institutions, to discover how culture and society work.

SOCA members are mathematicians, physicists, biologists, computer scientists and engineers. We're studying the evolution of music, the neurobiology of creativity, the dynamics of twitter networks, digital markets, online collaborations, the application of text mining to health and much else besides. Embedded within Imperial's Data Science Institute, the SOCA lab launched in November 2015.
