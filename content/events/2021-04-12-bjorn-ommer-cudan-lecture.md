**Abstract** – What is the next frontier of the Digital Humanities? Which methodological advances are needed to fully leverage the potential enabled by massive digitization and to further empower research? Digitization has significantly changed the storage, transfer, and accessibility of facsimiles of artifacts. However, the methods to open up the content hidden in the digitized data are still mostly reminiscent of the traditional analog means and not utilizing the full potential. The talk will discuss present limitations, propose ways to improve the accessibility of content, and present novel avenues opened up by current research in Deep Learning.
