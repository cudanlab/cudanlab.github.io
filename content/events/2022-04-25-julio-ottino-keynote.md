**Abstract** – Today’s complex problems demand a radically new way of thinking—one in which art, technology, and science converge to expand our creativity and augment our insight. This is The Nexus: the space where analytical, logical, methodical, sequential, and convergent thinking, normally associated with the sciences, coexists and synergizes with the creative, holistic, exploratory, metaphorical, and divergent thinking, typically attributed to the arts. In this provocative and visually striking book, Julio Mario Ottino and Bruce Mau bring together word and image to prepare us—individuals and organizations alike—for the challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century. Creativity must be combined with the ability to execute; the innovators of the future will have to understand this balance and manage such complexities as climate change and pandemics. The Nexus offers a guide for navigating the intersections of art, technology, and science. Compelling historic examples illuminate the present, from the Renaissance, when the domains were one, to the twentieth century, with intense, collective creative outpourings from places as different as the Bauhaus and Bell Labs. Leaders must be able to grasp simplicity in complexity and complexity in simplicity—and embrace the powerful idea of complementarity, where opposing extremes coexist, and our thinking expands. Innovation needs more than managing. Managers use maps; leaders develop compasses.
