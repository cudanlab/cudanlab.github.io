**Abstract** – Wikimedia Foundation is building a new project in which we allow contributors to create content in a language independent notation that can be translated to natural language text automatically. This will allow us to provide a baseline of knowledge in more than 300 hundred languages, with a high coverage, correctness, and being up-to-date. In this talk we present Wikifunctions, and how it is used to make Abstract Wikipedia work. We invite to discuss the implications of the project.
