**Abstract** – The Interactive Visual Intelligence Lab at the Institute of Industrial Science, the University of Tokyo, conducts research at the intersection of computer vision and human-computer interaction (HCI). Our work focuses on developing advanced techniques for vision-based human sensing, designing adaptive interfaces for ML models, and creating systems that engage diverse populations in data collection and interaction. By pushing the boundaries of these fields, we aim to create inclusive and intelligent technologies that enhance how people interact with AIs and computers and positively impact their daily lives.  
  
**Additional information** – The Interactive Visual Intelligence Lab is a Laboratory at Tokyo University, Japan headed by professor Yusuke Sugano. The lab is focused on developing machine learning approaches to computer vision and human-computer interaction, and conducting research ranging from basic methodologies to application systems.
