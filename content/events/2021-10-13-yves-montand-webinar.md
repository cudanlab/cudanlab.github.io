**Abstract** – CUDAN Senior Research Fellow Mila Oiva gave a talk at a workshop dedicated to the Yves Montand’s 100th birthday.  

Yves Montand (born as Ivo Livi, 1921-1991) was a celebrated singer and actor whose fame reached different continents and even transcended the borders of the Cold War.  

On October 13th, 2021 at 1.00-2.30pm EEST (at 11 am in London, 12 am in Paris and 1pm in Moscow) we will celebrate Yves Montand’s 100th birthday by organizing an online seminar. The event is based on the book Yves Montand in the USSR. Cultural Diplomacy and Mixed Messages (Palgrave-Macmillan, 2021).
