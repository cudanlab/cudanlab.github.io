**Abstract** – CUDAN ERA Chair Maximilian Schich spoke at the Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe on art networks. The discussion is in a live online panel format and explores what are art networks and how did they change over time? While scientists Mitali Banerjee and Maximilian Schich shed light on this question from a theoretical point of view, curator Viola Lukács and physicist Albert-László Barabási actively participate in the art network.
