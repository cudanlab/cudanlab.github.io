**Abstract** – (to be announced)    
  
**Additional information** – David Kinney is a Lecturer in the Psychology Department at Yale University and a visiting researcher at Google Research. He completed his PhD at the London School of Economics, and was previously a postdoc at Princeton University and at the Santa Fe Institute. Dr Kinney studies intuitive and scientific modes of causal cognition. Hist research concerns normative and descriptive aspects of causal reasoning, with a specific focus on how humans select causal features to include in models of our environment as well as the relationship between causal cognition and other cognitive processes like decision making, sociality, and morality in both human and artificial agents.
