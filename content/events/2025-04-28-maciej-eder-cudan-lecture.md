***Lecture title***  
Computational Literary Studies: A gentle introduction  

**Abstract**  
The talk will revolve around text analysis methodology, and the question of measuring stylistic similarity between (literary) texts. Since  similarity is one of the core concepts in authorship attribution, which  is traditionally aimed at identifying the works that are stylistically  similar to an anonymous text in question, the same idea can be easily adopted to assess any set of texts, even an entire literary tradition at a time. Consequently, instead of looking for authorship, such an  analysis is aimed at tracing other stylistic/linguistic signals: genre,  gender, chronology, intertextuality, and so forth. The presentation will focus on some of these applications, with special attention paid to  reliability issues.
