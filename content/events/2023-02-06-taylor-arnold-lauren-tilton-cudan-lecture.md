**Abstract** â€“ How might viewing images through computational methods support the study of visual culture? This talk will address this question in two parts. The first half will begin by discussing our work on the theory of distant viewing, which sits at the intersection of digital humanities and computer vision. The second part will turn to a concrete example showing how distant viewing furthers the study of visual culture. We will conclude by discussing our ongoing collaborations with cultural heritage institutions.
