**Abstract** â€“ In this presentation, Jer Thorp will share a decade's worth of work that seeks to break down the rules we have built for data representation, and the rigid demands we've put on our audiences. Starting with static visualization and stretching to sculpture, performance and participatory art, Thorp will examine how refusing to comply with Tuftian standards might give data a chance to speak to wider audiences about complex topics.
