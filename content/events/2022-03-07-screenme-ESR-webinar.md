**Abstract** – CUDAN Research Fellow Vejune Zemaityte will give a talk at ScreenME ESR webinar titled “Spotlight on Early Stage Researchers: Vejune Zemaityte and Ivana Kostovska tell us about their research and the challenges”. In the talk “Using social network analysis to study gender inequality in screen media industries” Vejune will introduce her research into gender diversity in screen media production which focuses on the relational labour structures that foster inequality. She will discuss the intricacies of working with large, industry-born datasets and the adoption of social network analysis methods for studying creative industries. The challenges and opportunities that arise when conducting industry-facing research in close collaboration with external partners will also be explored.
