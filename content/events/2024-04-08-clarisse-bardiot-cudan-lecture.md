**Abstract** – In digital humanities, particularly within performing arts analytics, maintaining a strong connection between data and its context is a challenge. This talk explores the integration of close and distant reading methodologies within a singular interface, aiming to prevent the loss of data’s original context and traceability. Current tools often focus on single-modal data analysis, overlooking the rich, multimodal nature of performing arts sources, including texts, images, sounds, videos, and programs.
Addressing this gap, I will introduce various tools and interfaces designed to facilitate comprehensive, multimodal analysis, ensuring data remains anchored to its originating context. A focal point of the discussion will be the "From Stage to Data, the Digital Turn of Contemporary Performing Arts Historiography" ERC project, which begun January 2024. STAGE’s key goal is, by placing performing arts studies in a digital context, to establish a new historiography of mise en scène and their creative processes in Europe since WWII. 
  
**Additional information** – Clarisse Bardiot is a Professor of history of contemporary theatre and digital humanities at Rennes 2 University. Her research focuses on performing arts digital traces, creative processes analysis, the history and aesthetics of digital performance, the preservation of digital works, and experimental publishing. With a team of developers, she designed digital environments for performing arts preservation and documentation: a software prototype, Rekall, and a web app, MemoRekall. She is the author of Performing Arts and Digital Humanities. From Traces to Data (Wiley / Iste, 2021). In 2023, she was awarded an ERC advanced Grant for a project called "From Stage to Data, the Digital Turn of Contemporary Performing Arts Historiography (STAGE)"
