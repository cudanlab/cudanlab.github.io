***Lecture title***   

**AI, Society, and Computing: Leveraging Global Data While Tackling Ethical Challenges**  

***Abstract***  
AI agents powered by individuals' data are reshaping everyday interactions on social platforms and marketplaces. At a planetary scale, the aggregation of multi-modal data enables transformative applications such as poverty mapping, socioeconomic predictions, and disaster assessments. However, these advancements also bring systemic risks, including biases, misinformation, and threats to democratic institutions.  

This talk explores how thoughtful design in database systems and AI can mitigate these challenges, foster sustainable development, and uphold human-centered values. It further advocates for the vigilant oversight of societal-scale AI applications to prevent dual-use and other ethical concerns and instead promote the benefit for humanity. I will also discuss my journey through my research on misinformation, as well as my life as a data scientist, based on my experiences collaborating with world-class scientists at Meta, AT&T Research, and Microsoft, as well as NGOs such as the United Nations Pulse Lab and the World Customs Organization.
