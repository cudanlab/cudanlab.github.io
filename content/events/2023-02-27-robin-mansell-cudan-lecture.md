**Abstract** – The claim that a balancing of commercial, state and citizen interests in digital innovation can be achieved is examined as a myth that works to conceal commitments to digital innovation outcomes that privilege the interests of technology companies and states. This talk emphasises the need to pay attention to the implementation of digital governance interventions if myths are to be exposed and digital systems consistent with citizens’ interests in autonomy, dignity and democracy are to become more prominent.
