***Lecture title***  
Socioeconomic patterns and their dynamics in social networks and language  
     
***Abstract***  
The uneven distribution of individual economic capacities are among the main forces, which shape modern societies and arguably bias the emerging behavioural patterns of people reflected by their social network and mobility patterns. However, the observation of socioeconomic networks is a major challenge as it requires the combination of behavioural and socioeconomic data at the individual level. In this talk we will discuss a set of results to study how socioeconomic status of people induce segregation patterns in social and mobility networks. While these segregation patterns evolve gradually, yet they can change abruptly in response to external shocks. Building on mobile phone call and mobility datasets of the same population, we will demonstrate how lockdown interventions lead to the re-organization of socioeconomic network segregation patterns. Subsequently, we will discuss a dataset combining Twitter corpuses with detailed socioeconomic maps obtained from national census. We show how key linguistic variables measured in individual Twitter streams depend on factors like socioeconomic status, location, time, and the social network of individuals.
