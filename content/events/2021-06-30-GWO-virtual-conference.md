**Abstract** – CUDAN Senior Research Fellow Vejune Zemaityte and her co-authors Dr Amanda Coles (Deakin University), Prof Dr Deb Verhoeven (University of Alberta), and Dr Justine Ferrer (Deakin University) will give a talk titled ‘Gender Inequality in Australian Film & TV: Using a Mixed-Method Approach to Study the Working Conditions of Cinematographers’ at the Gender, Work & Organization (GWO) Virtual Conference happening online during June 30–July 2, 2021.

This paper presents findings from one of the first major analyses of gender inequality among cinematographers and camera teams spanning an entire jurisdiction: the film and TV industries of Australia between 2010 and 2019. The study, conducted collaboratively with the Australian Cinematographers Society (ACS), uses both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to produce insights into workforce development, skills, and labour market conditions.

Gender inequality is a defining feature of labour markets in the screen industries, and an issue of economic, social, and cultural significance. Much of the existing research has focused on directors and, to a lesser extent, producers as the key creative occupations. Producers and directors are deeply influential in shaping the on-screen content and hiring other key creative roles involved in the screen production process. One of the most significant of those additional roles is that of cinematographer. Cinematographers, or Directors of Photography (DOPs), work in close association with the director in the creation of screen-based content. DOPs lead the camera department and oversee the work of other key technical departments, including lighting and grip. Yet despite their importance in both creative and industrial contexts, there is almost no research that focuses on the workforce profile and the gendered dynamics of work and labour markets in cinematography.

The limited research available on cinematographers and the camera department signals an occupation that is overwhelmingly male-dominated, with gender inequality in camera departments sharpening as career paths progress. A gender balance of men and women within departments is more prevalent in entry-level positions. Yet, as with other occupations and industries, men progress to decision-making levels, and lucrative income brackets, at much higher rates than women.

We conducted an equity, diversity, and inclusion analysis of the career paths and labour market dynamics within the Australian cinematography sector using a mixed-methods approach. For the quantitative component of this study, we used Social Network Analysis to better understand the relational networks of the Australian film and TV production industry during 2010–2019 and identify potential workforce patterns, as well as employment and career progression barriers and accelerants, within camera departments and wider employment networks of creative teams. A workforce survey open to both active and inactive members of the Australian Cinematographers Society constituted the qualitative component of this research. It focused on the socio-demographic profile of respondents in relation to work opportunities, workplace culture, labour market, and career progression indicators. In combination with the results from the Social Network Analysis, the survey data provided a rich and textured understanding of the gendered work and employment conditions for camera professionals in the Australian screen production industry.

This study is significant not only in the new knowledge it derives about the gender dynamics within an understudied screen production sector but also an example of participatory, industry-facing research. We describe the process of working iteratively with a collaborating organization, the Australian Cinematographers Society, using a feminist agile approach to project processes and protocols.
