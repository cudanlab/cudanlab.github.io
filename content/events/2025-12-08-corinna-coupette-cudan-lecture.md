**Computational Perspectives on Legal Systems**  

***Abstract***  

From 'legal technology' to 'computational legal studies' and 'digital law',  there are many opportunities to build bridges between law and computer science. While most work in the intersection of these disciplines has been motivated by the immediate challenges of contemporary legal  practice, in this talk, I will focus on the infrastructure producing these challenges: legal systems. Starting from the insight that legal systems are complex systems dealing with wicked problems, I will sketch how computational perspectives can help us understand the legal systems we have today and imagine the legal systems of the future.
