**Digital Data in the Service of Cultural Heritage**

Abstract:
This presentation is concerned with the evolution of Soviet audio-visual culture during 1927-1994. Newsreels—short news films shown in cinemas right before the main feature—served as illustrators of the news provided by newspapers and radio to wider audiences in the 20th century. The Soviet newsreel scene was rich, featuring various thematic series, and the genre survived much longer than in the West: until the 1990s. What were the characteristics of the audiovisual landscape of Soviet newsreels and how did they change over time? Here we introduce a new project which explores a vast cultural heritage collection of Soviet newsreels to characterize the continuities and changes in the official Soviet representations of world events.  

We   show   how   a   large   Russian-language   collection   of   newsreels,   digitized   by   Net-Film (www.net-film.ru),   opens   unprecedented   possibilities to   systematically   explore   long-term cultural   phenomenae. We aim to challenge the existing perceptions of Soviet informational audio-visual culture and provide new insights by employing a cultural-data analytics approach. Driven by and integrated with strong expertise in cultural history, this approach entails a data science  workflow pipeline,  including  audiovisual machine  learning  methods,  as well as  is complimented by insight from film studies and creative industries disciplines. The research questions   of   the   project   concern   the   temporal   patterns   that   can   be  identified through   the exploration of places or organizations depicted in newsreels, the composition of film production labour networks, and the aesthetic features of footage. The presentation also discusses the intricacies of using digitized cultural heritage collections in interdisciplinary projects, including
