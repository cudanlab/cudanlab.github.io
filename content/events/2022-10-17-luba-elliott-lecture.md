**Abstract** â€“ The past few years have seen the development of AI art as a trend. From its beginnings with DeepDream and style transfer to GANs, GPT-3 and DALL-E, AI art has long moved beyond the world of research and academia to find itself straddling the worlds of media and contemporary art and now NFTs. The contemporary art world's fascination with the social impact of facial recognition, recommendation systems and deep fakes has encouraged artists to explore AI critically as subject matter, while NFTs have shifted the focus back to aesthetics. This talk will give an overview of how artists and technologists are using and thinking about machine learning, its creative potential and societal impact.
