**Abstract** – In this lecture, Helle Sjøvaag will present ongoing work from her research project “The
datafication of communicative power: Towards an independent media policy for Norway’s
digital infrastructures” funded by the Research council of Norway. Sjøvaag has mapped the
backbone infrastructures on which the media industries rely, focused on the actors, data
streams and regulations that shape the value chains of the digital media sector. During the
presentation, Sjøvaag will discuss how these backbone networks (subsea cables, data
centres, content delivery networks (CDNs) and internet exchange points) influence the flow
of data in digital communication. A case study of the role of CDNs and cloud computing for
broadcasting will then serve as a basis for a discussion of what exactly distribution means in
the “post-tv” era.

**Abstract** – Helle Sjøvaag is Professor of Journalism at the University of Stavanger, Norway. Her work
currently focuses on media industries, regulation, and infrastructures. Her latest book is The
markets for news: Enduring structures in the age of business model disruption, published by
Routledge (2022). In the Fall 2023 she is launching a new Master Programme in Digital
Society, aimed at educating social science candidates that also understand technology.
