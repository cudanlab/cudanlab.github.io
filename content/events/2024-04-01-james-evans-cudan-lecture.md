**Abstract** – (to be announced)    
  
**Additional information** – James Evans is the Director of the Knowledge Lab and Max Palevsky Professor in Sociology at the University of Chicago. His research focuses on the collective system of thinking and knowing, ranging from the distribution of attention and intuition, the origin of ideas and shared habits of reasoning to processes of agreement (and dispute), accumulation of certainty (and doubt), and the texture — novelty, ambiguity, topology — of human understanding. He is especially interested in innovation — how new ideas and practices emerge — and the role that social and technical institutions (e.g., the Internet, markets, collaborations) play in collective cognition and discovery.
