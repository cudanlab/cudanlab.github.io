**Abstract** â€“ Observation of human activity in cities has traditionally been the method to understand urban dynamics.  Observation of human activity in cities has traditionally been the method to understand urban dynamics. Our group Mappingame has approached human activity analysis by employing different types of Location-based social networks data. This talk presents some key facts related to the methodology we use as well as a series of case-studies that have contributed to elaborate this research method which, in turn, helps to unveil the traces of the socio-functional city pulse lying hidden behind digital footprints.
