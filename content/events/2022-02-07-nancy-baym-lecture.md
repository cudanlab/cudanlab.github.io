**Abstract** – Nancy Baym, Senior Principal Research Manager, Microsoft Research will give a lecture on "The Future of Tensions at Work".  

With workers around the globe sent home to work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become clear that for many, work will never be quite the same. This talk draws on the speaker’s own work, as well as her involvement with Microsoft’s cross-company New Future of Work initiative, to explore recent research in how communication patterns at work have shifted, and how the tensions raised by these shifts may endure long after the pandemic has passed.
