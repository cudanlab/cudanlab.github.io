University Campus Bio-Medico, Rome    

***Lecture title***  
Global Biodata Governance: Epistemic and Ethical Issues Enhancing Human Rights, Flourishing and Prosperity  

***Abstract***  
The rapid advancements in biotechnology and the increasing generation, collection, and use of biological data (biodata) have revolutionized scientific research and healthcare. However, the current landscape of biodata governance is fragmented, hindering international collaboration and raising concerns about data ownership, access, benefit-sharing, privacy and potential misuse. At the crossroad of these issues there are epistemic assumptions and goals that ask to be disentangled to allow sustainable innovation, reliable healthcare processes and responsible social and political decisions. In the talk I will thus share a conceptual map to navigate the complexity of the current scenarios, quite often mediated by digital technologies, and understand better what is at stake for the scientific, technological and socio-economic practices.
