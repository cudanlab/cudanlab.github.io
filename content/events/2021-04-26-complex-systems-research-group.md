**Abstract** – We will introduce the Complex Systems research group at Aalto University, Finland. Our focus is on network science, and we’ll present a short introduction to two key topics in our work. The first is temporal networks — networks formed by contacts happening at specific times, such as networks of phone calls or messages that are important for information transmission, or networks of the physical proximity of people that are important for disease transmission. The second is multilayer networks — networks whose separate layers represent different types of interactions, such as brain activities on different frequency bands, or different public transport modalities (tram/bus/metro). We’ll also give a quick introduction to some of the projects that we are currently working on.
