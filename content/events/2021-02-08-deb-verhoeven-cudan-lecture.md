**Abstract** – This presentation will serve as an introduction to a “scaled” approach to Cinema Studies enabled by computational analysis, an approach the Kinomatics team has been honing for more than 10 years. It  will look at the mutual value of cinema distribution studies (as a global analysis of cultural infrastructure) and Digital Humanities (as an argument for methodological complexity, contingency, collaboration, contestation, and interpretation). By addressing “scale” as both an object of study (for example, examining the elastic relation of individual cinema’s screens to global distribution patterns) and an approach to analysis itself (how we have moved beyond individual researchers and research questions to a set of expanded practices), this presentation reveals how Kinomatics mobilises attentiveness to uneven acts of cultural distribution in order to give insight into their redistribution.
