**Abstract** – Humans and other cognitive systems rely on sensory information to assign value to objects, situations, and events they encounter or anticipate, depending on their current state, goals, and expectations. So, the ability to judge the world as desirable or avoidable, liked or disliked, beneficial or damaging enables comparing, deciding, and prioritizing actions. The evaluation of sensory objects is, therefore, a fundamental aspect of cognition, crucial for survival. Aesthetic or hedonic sensitivity, conceived as the individual responsiveness in the hedonic evaluation of a particular stimulus property, has proven an excellent tool to advance knowledge in this realm. However, our experience of and interaction with the world are eminently multisensory and dynamic, so we constantly process and weigh endogenous and exogenous information from multiple sensory streams at multiple temporal dimensions. Thus, although musical and visual complexity is known to affect the experience of music and paintings, respectively, how they are integrated into the experience of film or dance, for example, requires further consideration. In this seminar, we will discuss some ideas and approaches to the challenges imposed by such inherent complexity of hedonic evaluation.
