**Abstract** – John Hartley, Indrek Ibrus and Maarja Ojamaa discuss their recent book in which they developed their own updated and reworked model of Juri Lotman's (1922-93) evolutionary and dynamic approach to the semiosphere or cultural universe. On the Digital Semiosphere shows how Lotman's general model of the semiosphere provides a unique and compelling key to the dynamics and functions of today's globalised digital media systems and, in turn, their interactions and impact on planetary systems. The authors offer a unique account of the world-scale mechanisms that shape media, meanings, creativity and change – both productive and destructive. In so doing, they re-examine the relations among the contributing sciences and disciplines that have emerged to explain these phenomena, seeking to close the gap between biosciences and humanities in an integrated 'cultural science' approach.
