Mila Oiva – “The Ancient Finnish Kings”: pseudohistory, conspiracy theories and text reuse
Are all European monarchs descendants of the “Ancient Finnish Kings”? Did these medieval rulers establish colonies in space? Are these historical realities kept hidden by governments and academics? Fabricated through a pseudohistorical discourse, the epic of these imaginary heroes feeds conspiracy theories on the occultation of “true” history, nourishes nationalist rhetoric in Finland and Russia, and blurs the border between science and fiction by gradually spreading from the fringes of the Internet to the mainstream media.
